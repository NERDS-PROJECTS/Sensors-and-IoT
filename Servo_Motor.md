## Topic: Servomotor
_by-Kashish Sharma_

## Introduction

A servomotor is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise
control of angular or linear position, velocity, and acceleration. It consists
of a suitable motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback. It also
requires a relatively sophisticated controller, often a dedicated module
designed specifically for use with servomotors.
Servomotors are not a specific class of motor, although the term
servomotor is often used to refer to a motor suitable for use in a
closed-loop control system.
Servomotors are used in applications such as robotics, CNC machinery,
and automated manufacturing.

## Motors

The type of motor is not critical to a servomotor, and different types may be
used.At the simplest, brushed permanent magnet DC motors are used,
owing to their simplicity and low cost. Small industrial servomotors are
typically electronically commutated brushless motors.For large industrial
servomotors, AC induction motors are typically used, often with variable
frequency drives to allow control of their speed. For ultimate performance
in a compact package, brushless AC motors with permanent magnet fields
are used, effectively large versions of Brushless DC electric motors.
Drive modules for servomotors are a standard industrial component. Their
design is a branch of power electronics, usually based on a three-phase
MOSFET or IGBT H bridge. These standard modules accept a single
direction and pulse count (rotation distance) as input. They may also
include over-temperature monitoring, over-torque, and stall detection
features. As the encoder type, gearhead ratio, and overall system dynamics
are application specific, it is more difficult to produce the overall controller
as an off-the-shelf module, and so these are often implemented as part of
the main controller.

## Integrated servomotors

Integrated servomotors are designed to include the motor, driver, encoder, and
associated electronics into a single package.

## Servo Motor Construction

The following figure shows the construction of a standard servo motor. ISL
Products offers a wide variety of servo motors to accommodate different
industrial applications.
The servo motor consists of two winding stator and rotor windings. The
stator winding is wound on the stationary part of the motor, and this
winding is also called field winding of the motor. The rotor winding is
wound on the rotating part of the motor and this winding is also called the
armature winding of the motor. The motor consists of two bearings on
the front and backside for the free movement of the shaft. The
encoder has the approximate sensor for determining the rotational speed
and revolution per minute of the motor. Our Motor Selection Guide will help
you identify your requirements.

## Servo Motor Working Mechanism

It consists of three parts:
1. Controlled device
2. Output sensor
3. Feedback system
It is a closed-loop system where it uses a positive feedback system to
control motion and the final position of the shaft. Here the device is
controlled by a feedback signal generated by comparing output signal
and reference input signal.
Here reference input signal is compared to the reference output signal
and the third signal is produced by the feedback system. And this third
signal acts as an input signal to the control the device. This signal is
present as long as the feedback signal is generated or there is a
difference between the reference input signal and reference output
signal. So the main task of servomechanism is to maintain the output of
a system at the desired value at presence of noises.

## Servo Motor Working Principle

A servo consists of a Motor (DC or AC), a potentiometer, gear assembly,
and a controlling circuit. First of all, we use gear assembly to reduce
RPM and to increase torque of the motor. Say at initial position of servo
motor shaft, the position of the potentiometer knob is such that there is
no electrical signal generated at the output port of the potentiometer.
Now an electrical signal is given to another input terminal of the error
detector amplifier. Now the difference between these two signals, one
comes from the potentiometer and another comes from other sources,
will be processed in a feedback mechanism and output will be provided
in terms of error signal. This error signal acts as the input for motor and
motor starts rotating. Now motor shaft is connected with the
potentiometer and as the motor rotates so the potentiometer and it will
generate a signal. So as the potentiometer’s angular position changes,
its output feedback signal changes. After sometime the position of
potentiometer reaches at a position that the output of potentiometer is
same as external signal provided. At this condition, there will be no
output signal from the amplifier to the motor input as there is no
difference between external applied signal and the signal generated at
potentiometer, and in this situation motor stops rotating.

## Interfacing Servo Motors with Microcontrollers

Interfacing hobby Servo motors like s90 servo motor with MCU is very
easy. Servos have three wires coming out of them. Out of which two will
be used for Supply (positive and negative) and one will be used for the
signal that is to be sent from the MCU. An MG995 Metal Gear Servo
Motor which is most commonly used for RC cars humanoid bots etc.
The picture of MG995 is shown below:

The color coding of your servo motor might differ hence check for your
respective datasheet.
All servo motors work directly with your +5V supply rails but we have to
be careful on the amount of current the motor would consume if you are
planning to use more than two servo motors a proper servo shield
should be designed.

## Servo Motor Basics with Arduino

The Servo Library is a great library for controlling servo motors. In this
article, you will find two easy examples that can be used by any Arduino
board.
The first example controls the position of a RC (hobby) servo motor with
your Arduino and a potentiometer. The second example sweeps the shaft of
a RC servo motor back and forth across 180 degrees.

### Hardware Required
-Arduino Board
-Servo Motor
-10k ohm potentiometer
-hook-up wires

### Circuit
Servo motors have three wires: power, ground, and signal. The power wire is
typically red, and should be connected to the 5V pin on the Arduino board. The
ground wire is typically black or brown and should be connected to a ground
pin on the board. The signal pin is typically yellow or orange and should be
connected to PWM pin on the board. In these examples, it is pin number 9

### Knob Circuit
For the Knob example, wire the potentiometer so that its two outer pins are
connected to power (+5V) and ground, and its middle pin is connected to A0
on the board. Then, connect the servo motor to +5V, GND and pin 9.

### Sweep Circuit
For the Sweep example, connect the servo motor to +5V, GND and pin
9.a

### Examples
Knob
Controlling a servo position using a potentiometer (variable resistor).

#include <Servo.h>
Servo myservo; // create servo object to control a servo
int potpin = 0; // analog pin used to connect the potentiometer
int val; // variable to read the value from the analog pin
void setup() {
myservo.attach(9); // attaches the servo on pin 9 to the servo object
}
void loop() {
val = analogRead(potpin); // reads the value of the potentiometer (value
between 0 and 1023)
val = map(val, 0, 1023, 0, 180); // scale it to use it with the servo (value
between 0 and 180)
myservo.write(val); // sets the servo position according to the
scaled value
delay(15); // waits for the servo to get there
}
Sweep
Sweeps the shaft of a RC servo motor back and forth across 180 degrees.
#include <Servo.h>
Servo myservo; // create servo object to control a servo
// twelve servo objects can be created on most boards
int pos = 0; // variable to store the servo position
void setup() {
myservo.attach(9); // attaches the servo on pin 9 to the servo object
}
void loop() {
for (pos = 0; pos <= 180; pos += 1) { // goes from 0 degrees to 180 degrees
// in steps of 1 degree
myservo.write(pos); // tell servo to go to position in variable 'pos'
delay(15); // waits 15ms for the servo to reach the position
}
for (pos = 180; pos >= 0; pos -= 1) { // goes from 180 degrees to 0 degrees
myservo.write(pos); // tell servo to go to position in variable 'pos'
delay(15); // waits 15ms for the servo to reach the position
}
}

## Controlling Servo Motor:

All motors have three wires coming out of them. Out of which two will be
used for Supply (positive and negative) and one will be used for the
signal that is to be sent from the MCU.
Servo motor is controlled by PWM (Pulse with Modulation) which is
provided by the control wires. There is a minimum pulse, a maximum
pulse and a repetition rate. Servo motor can turn 90 degree from either
direction form its neutral position. The servo motor expects to see a
pulse every 20 milliseconds (ms) and the length of the pulse will
determine how far the motor turns. For example, a 1.5ms pulse will make
the motor turn to the 90° position, such as if pulse is shorter than 1.5ms
shaft moves to 0° and if it is longer than 1.5ms than it will turn the servo
to 180°.
Servo motor works on PWM (Pulse width modulation) principle, means
its angle of rotation is controlled by the duration of applied pulse to its
Control PIN. Basically servo motor is made up of DC motor which is
controlled by a variable resistor (potentiometer) and some gears. High
speed force of DC motor is converted into torque by Gears. We know
that WORK= FORCE X DISTANCE, in DC motor Force is less and
distance (speed) is high and in Servo, force is High and distance is less.
The potentiometer is connected to the output shaft of the Servo, to
calculate the angle and stop the DC motor on the required angle.
![Aspose Words 40038974-82e4-49c2-817d-fc7177d4defb 007](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69229860/221582704-a817d0cd-d14f-4d10-a224-5ed11f0cc0fd.png)

Servo motor can be rotated from 0 to 180 degrees, but it can go up to
210 degrees, depending on the manufacturing. This degree of rotation
can be controlled by applying the Electrical Pulse of proper width, to its
Control pin. Servo checks the pulse in every 20 milliseconds. The pulse
of 1 ms (1 millisecond) width can rotate the servo to 0 degrees, 1.5ms
can rotate to 90 degrees (neutral position) and 2 ms pulse can rotate it to
180 degree.
All servo motors work directly with your +5V supply rails but we have to
be careful about the amount of current the motor would consume if you
are planning to use more than two servo motors a proper servo shield
should be designed.

## Advantages:

● If a heavy load is placed on the motor, the driver will increase
the current to the motor coil as it attempts to rotate the motor.
There is no out-of-step condition.
● High-speed operation is possible.

## Disadvantages:

● Since the servomotor tries to rotate according to the
command pulses but lags, it is not suitable for precision
control of rotation.
● Higher cost.
● When stopped, the motor’s rotor continues to move back and
forth one pulse, so that it is not suitable if you need to prevent
vibration

## Conclusion:

To summarise, servo motors are used in many industries and have
several advantages. They provide a solution to many mechanical
problems and have features that make them powerful and efficient.
As you can see from our article, they can be used in anything from
toy cars to high industry, complex robotics. It’s the ideal motor to use
for your motion control projects, and because it’s so energy efficient,
you’ll be saving on your electricity bill as well!
